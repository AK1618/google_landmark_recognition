# Google Landmark Recognition Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for landmark recognition developed by [Your Name]. The model is trained on the dataset obtained from the Kaggle competition: Landmark Recognition 2020.

## Overview

The Google Landmark Recognition Model is designed to identify landmarks in images using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. It utilizes a deep learning architecture to learn features from images and make predictions about the landmarks present.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train and evaluate the model is sourced from the Kaggle competition: Landmark Recognition 2020. To access the dataset, please visit the competition page and follow the instructions to download the data files. The dataset consists of a large number of images with corresponding labels indicating the landmark depicted in each image.

It is important to note that the dataset provided on Kaggle might require preprocessing and organization before it can be used directly in the model. Please refer to the competition documentation for any specific instructions on data preparation.

## Model Architecture

The Google Landmark Recognition Model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract meaningful features from input images. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling, activation functions, and fully connected layers for classification. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the source code files of this repository.

## Getting Started

To use the Google Landmark Recognition Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-landmark-recognition.git
2. Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page: Landmark Recognition 2020
4. Preprocess the dataset as needed (refer to the competition documentation for guidelines)
5. Train the model using the prepared dataset: python train.py
6. Evaluate the trained model: python evaluate.py

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements. Make sure to refer to the documentation within the source code files for additional details on each script's functionality and usage.
